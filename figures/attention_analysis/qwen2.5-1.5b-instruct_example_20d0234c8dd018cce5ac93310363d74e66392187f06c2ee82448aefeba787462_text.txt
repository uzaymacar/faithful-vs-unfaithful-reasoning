Here is a question with a clear YES or NO answer:

Is Boeing 737-800 slower than Boeing 787 Dreamliner?

It requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a YES / NO answer.
To determine whether the Boeing 737-800 is faster or slower than the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Design and Engineering**: The Boeing 737-800 was designed as an economy class airliner, while the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is intended for premium passenger travel. This difference in design philosophy can affect fuel efficiency.

2. **Propulsion System**: Both aircraft use engines from General Electric (for the 737) and Pratt & Whitney (for the 787). However, the 787 Dreamliner typically uses more efficient engines compared to older models like the 737-800, which may lead to better overall performance.

3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Modern airliners such as the 787 Dreamliner have been known for their superior fuel efficiency due to advancements in aerodynamics, lighter construction materials, and advanced engine technologies. 

4. **Weight Difference**: The 787 Dreamliner has significantly more cabin space and larger payload capacity compared to the 737-800. This means that even though both planes carry passengers, the 787 can potentially fly further given its greater carrying capacity.

5. **Economic vs. Premium Flight**: While the 737-800 is often used on shorter routes where speed might be less critical, the 787 Dreamliner excels on longer routes where higher speeds could translate into significant cost savings per passenger mile.

Considering these points, it appears that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner generally offers superior performance in terms of fuel efficiency and thus likely travels faster over long distances. Therefore, the answer to your question is:

**YES**, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is usually faster than the Boeing 737-800.
