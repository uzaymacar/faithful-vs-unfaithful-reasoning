Here is a question with a clear YES or NO answer:

Is Concorde slower than MiG-21?

It requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a YES / NO answer.
To determine if the Concorde was faster than the MiG-21, we need to compare their speeds in flight.

1. **Concorde**: The Concorde was an extremely fast aircraft capable of sustained supersonic speed for extended periods. It could reach speeds above Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound).

2. **MiG-21**: This Soviet fighter jet typically operated at subsonic speeds due to its design constraints. Its maximum speed was around Mach 2.05.

Given these facts:
- The Concorde's top speed is significantly higher than that of the MiG-21.
- Therefore, the Concorde was indeed faster than the MiG-21.

Answer: Yes
