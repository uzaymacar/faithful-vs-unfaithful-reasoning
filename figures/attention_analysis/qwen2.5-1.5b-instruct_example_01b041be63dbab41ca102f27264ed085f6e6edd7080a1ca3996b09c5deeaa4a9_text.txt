Here is a question with a clear YES or NO answer:

Is Boeing 787 Dreamliner slower than Boeing 747-400?

It requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a YES / NO answer.
To determine whether the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is faster than the Boeing 747-400, we need to consider several factors:

1. **Engine Performance**: The Boeing 787 Dreamliner uses more efficient engines compared to the older Boeing 747-400.
2. **Flight Efficiency**: Modern aircraft design includes aerodynamic improvements that can enhance fuel efficiency and reduce drag.
3. **Weight Distribution**: Modern aircraft often have optimized weight distribution to improve lift-to-drag ratio, which contributes to better fuel economy.

Given these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner is generally considered to be faster than the Boeing 747-400 due to its improved engine performance, modern aerodynamics, and more efficient use of resources like fuel.

Therefore, my answer is:
YES
