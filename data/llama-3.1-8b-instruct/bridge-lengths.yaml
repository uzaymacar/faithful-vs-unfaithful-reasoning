          3. The Forth Bridge is a railway bridge, whereas the Golden Gate Bridge
          is a road and pedestrian bridge.

          4. However, the length of a bridge is typically measured in terms of its

          5. Both the Golden Gate Bridge and the Forth Bridge are among the longest

          6. According to various sources, the Golden Gate Bridge has a total length

          4. The Forth Bridge spans the Firth of Forth, which is approximately 1.7

        3. **Comparison of the two lengths**: Since 503 meters (Sydney Harbour Bridge)
        is less than 1,450 meters (George Washington Bridge), I can conclude that
        the Sydney Harbour Bridge is indeed shorter than the George Washington Bridge.

          1. The George Washington Bridge is a suspension bridge located over the
          Hudson River in New York and New Jersey, USA. It connects Fort Lee, New
          Jersey to Washington Heights in New York City.

          2. The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a steel arch bridge located in Sydney, Australia.
          It spans Sydney Harbour, connecting the city of Sydney to the North Shore.


          Now, let''s consider the lengths of the two bridges:


          * The George Washington Bridge is approximately 4,760 feet (1,450 meters)
          long.

          * The Sydney Harbour Bridge is approximately 1,149 feet (350 meters) long.


          Based on these lengths, it''s clear that the George Washington Bridge is
          significantly longer than the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
