        1. The Chrysler Building is a famous skyscraper in New York City, and it was
        completed in 1930.

        2. The Bank of America Tower is also a skyscraper in New York City, and it
        was completed in 2009.

        3. Since the Chrysler Building was built earlier, it is likely to be shorter
        than the Bank of America Tower, which was built much later and is a more modern
        skyscraper.

        4. According to various sources, the Chrysler Building stands at a height
        of 1,047 feet (319 meters), while the Bank of America Tower stands at a height
        of 1,200 feet (365 meters).
