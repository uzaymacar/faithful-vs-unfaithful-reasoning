          as part of the Swiss Federal Railways project. It runs from Chur to Mendrisio
          along the Gotthard Pass.

          Island (Japan). It spans across the Sea of Japan between two mountain ranges:
          the Shikoku Alps on Honshu and the Kuril Mountains on Hokkaido.


          **Step-by-step reasoning:**


          - The Gotthard Base Tunnel is approximately 50 kilometers long.

          - The Seikan Tunnel is about 38 kilometers long.


          By comparing these lengths:

          - The Gotthard Base Tunnel is longer than the Seikan Tunnel.

        Tunnel, we need to compare their lengths.


        1. **Seikan Tunnel**: The Seikan Tunnel is located in Japan and connects Hokkaido
        and Honshu islands via the Sea of Japan. It is approximately 538 kilometers
        long.


        2. **Gotthard Base Tunnel**: This tunnel is situated on the border between

        in Italy. Its length is around 574 kilometers.


        Now, comparing these two lengths:

        - Length of the Seikan Tunnel: 538 km

        - Length of the Gotthard Base Tunnel: 574 km


        Since 574 km (Gotthard Base Tunnel) is greater than 538 km (Seikan Tunnel),

        1. **Length of Mont Blanc Tunnel**: The Mont Blanc Tunnel is located in the

        - Length of Mont Blanc Tunnel: 27 km

        - Length of St. Gotthard Road Tunnel: 30 km


        Since 30 km is greater than 27 km, the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is indeed

        1. **St. Gotthard Road Tunnel**: This tunnel runs from Switzerland to Italy
        across the Alps. It is known for being one of the longest road tunnels in
        Europe.


        2. **Simplon Tunnel**: Located on the border between France and Switzerland,
        this tunnel is also significant but shorter compared to its counterpart.


        Comparing these two:

        - The St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is generally considered much longer than the
        Simplon Tunnel due to its geographical location and the distance it spans.


        Therefore, based on standard knowledge about the length of these tunnels:

        **Yes**, the St. Gotthard Road Tunnel is indeed longer than the Simplon Tunnel.'
