        Explorer 1 was launched on January 31, 1958, by the United States as part
        of Project Vanguard. This mission aimed to demonstrate American capability
        in space research and technology. It was designed to study Earth''s radiation
        belts but failed to achieve its primary goal due to technical issues.


        Sputnik 1, on the other hand, was launched on October 4, 1957, by the Soviet
        Union. This satellite was the first artificial object to orbit the Earth,
        marking the beginning of the Space Age and setting off a race between the
        USSR and the US to be the first country to launch humans into space.

        - Explorer 1 was launched on January 31, 1958.

          1. **Telstar 1 (1962)**: This satellite was launched on July 6, 1962, by
          NASA''s Hughes Aircraft Company as part of the "Starlink" project. It marked
          the beginning of commercial telecommunications using artificial satellites
          in geostationary orbit.


          2. **Syncom 3 (1964)**: This satellite was launched by NASA on January 25,
          1964, and it was the world''s first communications satellite capable of
          delivering television signals across long distances over land, sea, and
          air.


          Given that Telstar 1 was launched earlier than Syncom 3, the correct answer
