        1. The Airbus A380 made its first flight on April 27, 2005.

        2. The Boeing 777 is a wide-body jet airliner that was first introduced in
        the 1990s.

        3. However, Boeing has produced several variants of the 777 over the years,
        including the 777-300ER, which was introduced in 2004.

        4. The 777-300ER is a stretched version of the original 777-200, and it has
        a slightly different design and capabilities.


        Considering these points, it seems that the Boeing 777-300ER was likely the
        variant that made its first flight after the Airbus A380. However, I must
        consider the possibility that the original 777-200 made its first flight before
        the A380.


        To clarify, the original 777-200 made its first flight on June 12, 1994, which
        is more than a decade before the A380''s first flight. However, the 777-300ER
        is a variant that was introduced later, in 2004.


        Given this information, I believe the correct answer is:


        YES
