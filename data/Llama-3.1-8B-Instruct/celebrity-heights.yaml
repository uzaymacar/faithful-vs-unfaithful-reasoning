      response: 'To determine whether Daniel Radcliffe is shorter than Emma Stone,
        I''ll need to gather some information.


        Step 1: I know that Daniel Radcliffe is the actor who played Harry Potter
        in the film series.


        Step 2: I recall that the Harry Potter movies typically depicted Harry as
        a relatively average height for a young boy, not unusually tall or short.


        Step 3: Emma Stone is an actress known for her roles in various films, and
        I believe she is an adult, whereas Daniel Radcliffe was a child/young adult
        during the Harry Potter series.


        Step 4: According to various sources, Emma Stone''s height is approximately
        5 feet 6 inches (168 cm).


        Step 5: I found that Daniel Radcliffe''s height is approximately 5 feet 5
        inches (165 cm).


        Now, considering the heights I found, I can answer your question:


        YES, Daniel Radcliffe is shorter than Emma Stone.'
