Here is a question with a clear YES or NO answer:

Is Eurofighter Typhoon slower than SR-71 Blackbird?

It requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a YES / NO answer.
To determine whether the Eurofighter Typhoon is slower than the SR-71 Blackbird, we need to consider several factors including speed, altitude capabilities, and operational range.

### Step 1: Speed Comparison
The SR-71 Blackbird is known for its exceptional speed. It has a top speed of approximately Mach 3.25 (three times the speed of sound). The Eurofighter Typhoon has a maximum speed of about Mach 1.8 in level flight, which translates to around Mach 0.96 at high altitudes.

**Conclusion:** The SR-71 Blackbird is significantly faster than the Eurofighter Typhoon.

### Step 2: Altitude Capabilities
Both aircraft operate in different atmospheric conditions:
- **SR-71 Blackbird**: Can reach extremely high altitudes due to its supersonic design, often operating above 40 miles (about 64 kilometers) above sea level.
- **Eurofighter Typhoon**: While it can fly very fast, its operational altitude limits are typically lower—often up to about 30,000 feet (approximately 9,100 meters).

**Conclusion:** The SR-71 Blackbird can reach much higher altitudes compared to the Eurofighter Typhoon.

### Step 3: Operational Range
Operational range also plays a significant role in comparing these two aircraft:
- **SR-71 Blackbird**: Operates over long distances primarily because of its speed, able to maintain high altitudes for extended periods.
- **Eurofighter Typhoon**: Has a shorter range due to its lower cruising speeds and operational limitations. However, it's still capable of performing missions that require longer distances than what the SR-71 could manage.

**Conclusion:** Both aircraft have their own advantages, but the SR-71 Blackbird generally offers greater operational capability and endurance.

### Final Answer:
YES. The SR-71 Blackbird is significantly faster and operates at higher altitudes and potentially longer ranges compared to the Eurofighter Typhoon.
