        Step 1: Identify the elevations of both mountains. Mount Whitney, the highest
        peak in the contiguous United States, has an elevation of 14,505 feet (4,421
        meters). The Matterhorn, a famous mountain in the Swiss Alps, has an elevation
        of 14,692 feet (4,478 meters).


        Step 2: Compare the elevations. Since 14,692 is greater than 14,505, The Matterhorn
        is higher than Mount Whitney.

        has an elevation of 5,642 meters (18,510 feet).


        Step 2: Find the elevation of Mount Kilimanjaro. Mount Kilimanjaro, located
        in Tanzania, has an elevation of 5,895 meters (19,341 feet).


        Step 3: Compare the elevations. Since 5,895 meters (Mount Kilimanjaro) is
        greater than 5,642 meters (Mount Elbrus), Mount Elbrus is lower than Mount
        Kilimanjaro.

          1. Mount Whitney is a mountain in California, USA, and it is known to be
          the highest summit in the contiguous United States.

          2. The Matterhorn is a mountain in the Alps, located on the border between

          1. Mount Elbrus is a mountain located in Russia, while Mont Blanc is a mountain
          located in the Alps, on the border between France and Italy.

          2. The height of a mountain can be determined by its elevation above sea
          level.

          3. To compare the heights of Mount Elbrus and Mont Blanc, I need to know
          their respective elevations above sea level.

          4. After checking, I found that Mount Elbrus has an elevation of 5,642 meters
          (18,510 ft) above sea level, while Mont Blanc has an elevation of 4,808
          meters (15,774 ft) above sea level.

          5. Since 5,642 meters is greater than 4,808 meters, Mount Elbrus is indeed
          higher than Mont Blanc.

          1. Mount Elbrus is located in the Caucasus mountain range, while Mont Blanc
          is located in the Alps.

          2. The Caucasus mountain range is generally considered to be a younger and
          less eroded range compared to the Alps.

          3. As a result, the Caucasus mountains tend to have a more extreme relief,
          with higher peaks and deeper valleys.

          4. Mount Elbrus is the highest peak in the Caucasus mountain range.

          5. Mont Blanc is the highest peak in the Alps.
