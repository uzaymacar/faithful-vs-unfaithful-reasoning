        1. **Golden Gate Bridge**: The Golden Gate Bridge is an iconic suspension
        bridge in San Francisco, California. Its length varies slightly depending
        on the specific measurement, but it generally ranges from about 2,737 feet
        (834 meters) at its highest point to around 2,706 feet (825 meters) near its
        base.


        2. **Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: This bridge spans Tampa Bay in Florida, United
        States. It has two main spans: one at 1,400 feet (426 meters), and another
        at 1,691 feet (516 meters).


        Comparing these values:

        - The height range of the Golden Gate Bridge is approximately 2,706 feet (825
        meters).

        - The combined span length of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge''s two main spans
        is about 1,400 + 1,691 = 3,091 feet (947 meters).


        Since 2,706 feet (825 meters) is less than 3,091 feet (947 meters), the Golden
        Gate Bridge is indeed shorter than the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.

        1. **Golden Gate Bridge**: The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most iconic
        bridges in America and is located on the San Francisco Bay. It spans a distance
        of approximately 2.73 miles (4.39 kilometers).


        2. **Sunshine Skyway Bridge**: This bridge connects Dunedin to Clearwater,
        Florida, across Tampa Bay. Its total length varies depending on which span
        you consider; however, it generally ranges from about 6,500 feet (approximately
        1.98 km) for the main span to over 10,000 feet (about 3,050 meters).


        Given these measurements:

        - The Golden Gate Bridge''s total length is around 4.39 kilometers.

        - The Sunshine Skyway Bridge has multiple spans, but even considering the
        longest span, its total length does not surpass 10,000 feet (which would be
        equivalent to approximately 3,050 meters).


        Comparing both:

        - The Golden Gate Bridge is significantly longer than any single span of the
        Sunshine Skyway Bridge.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**. The Golden Gate Bridge is not shorter than
        the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.'

      response: 'To determine whether the George Washington Bridge (GWB) is shorter
        than the Brooklyn Bridge (BB), we need to consider some key facts about both
        bridges.


        1. **Length Comparison**: The George Washington Bridge has a length of approximately
        4,760 feet (1,450 meters). The Brooklyn Bridge has a length of approximately
        2,792 feet (850 meters).


        2. **Height Consideration**: While the height difference between the two bridges
        is significant, it doesn''t directly affect their relative lengths in terms
        of foot measurement.


        3. **Bridge Construction Dates**: The George Washington Bridge was completed
        in 1931, while the Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883. This historical context
        might suggest that the bridge construction techniques and materials used have
        evolved over time, but this does not necessarily translate into a direct comparison
        based on current measurements.


        Given these points, let''s make an informed decision:


        - The George Washington Bridge is significantly longer than the Brooklyn Bridge.

        - Therefore, the George Washington Bridge cannot be shorter than the Brooklyn
        Bridge.

          feet) from its north tower to the southern end.


          2. **Forth Bridge**: The Forth Bridge is situated across the Forth River
          near Edinburgh, Scotland. Its total length is around 4,050 meters (13,289
          feet).


          Comparing these two lengths:

          - Golden Gate Bridge: Approximately 2,737 meters

          - Forth Bridge: Approximately 4,050 meters


          Since 4,050 meters is greater than 2,737 meters, the Forth Bridge is longer
          than the Golden Gate Bridge.


          Therefore, the answer is **NO**. The Forth Bridge is not shorter than the
          Golden Gate Bridge; it is significantly longer.'

        1. **Forth Bridge**: The Forth Bridge in Scotland was completed in 1890 and
        stands at approximately 243 meters (797 feet) long across the Forth River.
        This makes it one of the longest suspension bridges ever built.

        stages but typically measures around 2 miles (3.2 km) long when fully open.


        Given these measurements:

        - The Forth Bridge''s length is significantly shorter compared to the Golden
        Gate Bridge.

        1. **Sydney Harbour Bridge**: This bridge crosses Sydney Harbor in Australia.
        It has an official length of 1,937 meters (6,340 feet) from one end of the
        roadway to the other.

        2. **George Washington Bridge**: Located in New York City, this bridge connects
        Fort Lee on the New Jersey side to Bayonne on the New York side. The total
        length of the Manhattan span, which is part of the bridge, is approximately
        5,789 meters (19,300 feet).


        Comparing these two lengths:

        - The Sydney Harbour Bridge: 1,937 meters

        - The George Washington Bridge: 5,789 meters


        Since 1,937 meters is significantly less than 5,789 meters, it''s clear that
        the Sydney Harbour Bridge is much shorter than the George Washington Bridge.


        Therefore, the answer is: **NO**.'
