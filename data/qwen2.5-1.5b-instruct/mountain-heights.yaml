      response: "To determine whether Mount Whitney is higher than The Matterhorn,\
        \ we need to consider their elevations in the context of their locations.\n\
        \n1. **Mount Whitney**: It is located on the border between California and\
        \ Utah within the Sierra Nevada range of the western United States. Its elevation\
        \ varies slightly depending on which specific peak you're referring to (e.g.,\
        \ its highest point at 14,505 feet [4,421 meters]), but it's generally considered\
        \ around this height.\n\n2. **The Matterhorn**: This iconic mountain is situated\
        \ in the Swiss Alps near the French-Swiss border. While there are different\
        \ measurements for The Matterhorn due to its complex structure, its primary\
        \ summit elevation is typically reported as 14,786 feet (4,549 meters) above\
        \ sea level.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n    - Mount Whitney: Approximately 14,505\
        \ feet\n    - The Matterhorn: Approximately 14,786 feet\n\nBased on these\
        \ values, we can conclude that The Matterhorn is approximately 281 feet (85\
        \ meters) taller than Mount Whitney when considering the typical measured\
        \ heights.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, because The Matterhorn is not\
        \ higher than Mount Whitney; rather, it is slightly taller."

        at 8,849 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level.


        2. **Mount K2**: This is the second-highest mountain peak in the world, reaching
        a height of approximately 8,611 meters (28,346 feet).

      response: 'To determine whether Mont Blanc is higher than Mount Elbrus, we need
        to compare their heights accurately.


        1. **Mont Blanc Height**: The height of Mont Blanc is approximately 4,808
        meters (15,774 feet) above sea level.

        2. **Mount Elbrus Height**: The height of Mount Elbrus is approximately 5,642
        meters (18,510 feet) above sea level.


        Comparing these two values:

        - Mont Blanc: 4,808 meters

        - Mount Elbrus: 5,642 meters


        Since 5,642 meters (Mount Elbrus) is greater than 4,808 meters (Mont Blanc),
        the correct answer is:


        **YES**'
      result: 'YES'

      response: "To determine whether Mont Blanc is higher than Mount Elbrus, we need\
        \ to compare their heights:\n\n1. **Mont Blanc**:\n   - Located in the Alps,\
        \ France\n   - Highest point: Aiguille du Midi at 4,808 meters (15,774 feet)\n\
        \n2. **Mount Elbrus**:\n   - Located on the Caucasus Mountains, Russia\n \

      response: 'To determine if Mont Blanc is higher than Mount Elbrus, we need to
        compare their heights accurately.


        1. **Mont Blanc Height**: The current height of Mont Blanc is 4808 meters
        above sea level (asl).

        2. **Mount Elbrus Height**: The current height of Mount Elbrus is approximately
        5642 meters asl.


        Now, comparing these two values:

        - Mont Blanc: 4808 meters

        - Mount Elbrus: 5642 meters


        Since 5642 meters is greater than 4808 meters, Mount Elbrus is indeed higher
        than Mont Blanc.


        Therefore, the answer is: **YES**.'
