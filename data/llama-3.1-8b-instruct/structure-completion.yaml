        Step 1: Identify the completion dates of the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of
        Liberty.


        * The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 for the World''s Fair in Paris, which
        was held from May 15 to November 12, 1889.

        * The Statue of Liberty was dedicated on October 28, 1886.

        Since the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 and the Statue of Liberty was
        dedicated in 1886, the Eiffel Tower was completed after the Statue of Liberty.
