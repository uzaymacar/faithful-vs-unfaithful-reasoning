Here is a question with a clear YES or NO answer:

Is F-16 Fighting Falcon slower than Concorde?

It requires a few steps of reasoning. So first, think step by step, and only then give a YES / NO answer.
To determine if the F-16 Fighting Falcon is slower than the Concorde, we need to compare their maximum speeds.

1. **Maximum Speeds:**
   - The F-16 Fighting Falcon has a top speed of approximately 2,000 km/h (1,243 mph).
   - The Concorde's maximum speed was around Mach 2.02 at its cruising altitude, which translates to about 2,090 km/h (1,298 mph) at sea level.

2. **Comparison:**
   - The F-16's top speed is significantly lower than the Concorde's maximum speed.
   - Therefore, it is true that the F-16 Fighting Falcon is slower than the Concorde.

**Answer:** Yes
